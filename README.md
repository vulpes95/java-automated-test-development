- [ ] Naming for test and test case
- [ ] Execution flows and corner cases
- [ ] Naming steps: AAA and GWT ways
- [ ] Fixture value
- [ ] Forgotten 1.5 step
- [ ] Test = fixed flow
- [ ] Test case = component specification
### Hands-on
- [ ] Given legacy codebase with Client and SavingAccount com.acme.banking.dbo.domain types
- [ ] When developers add guard clauses for creating Client and SavingAccount
- [ ] And cover these components with maintainable autotests
- [ ] Then public code review should state its maintainability

## How to measure test coverage? (2.5)
### Test reports
- [ ] Build tool test phases
- [ ] Separate reports
- [ ] Test error types: failure, error, ignored
### Test coverage
- [ ] Coverage definition
- [ ] Coverage metrics
- [ ] Coverage tooling
### Demo
- [ ] Add coverage tool dependency
- [ ] Project test coverage reports
### Hands-on
- [ ] Given legacy codebase with Client and SavingAccount com.acme.banking.dbo.domain types
- [ ] And added covering test suite
- [ ] When developers analyse coverage reprts
- [ ] And develop new tests
- [ ] Then coverage have to be ≥ 80%

## How to make test development faster? (2.5)
### Demo for Common features
- [ ] [Simple assertions](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.8/org/junit/Assert.html)
- [ ] [Composable assertions](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Matchers-and-assertthat)
- [ ] [Fluent assertions](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-quick-start.html)
- [ ] [Test timeouts](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Timeout-for-tests)
- [ ] [Testing exception flow](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Exception-testing)
- [ ] [Parameterized tests](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Parameterized-tests)
### Demo for Extending
- [ ] [Runners](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Test-runners)
- [ ] [Rules](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules)
### Demo for test suites
- [ ] Why test suites?
- [ ] Value for feedback process metrics
- [ ] Smoke suite
- [ ] [Groups](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/aggregating-tests-in-suites)
- [ ] [Categories](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Categories)
- [ ] Build tool support for scoped tests run
### Hands-on
- [ ] Given legacy codebase with Client and SavingAccount com.acme.banking.dbo.domain types
- [ ] When developers add consistency rules for linking Client and SavingAccount
- [ ] And cover these components with maintainable autotests
- [ ] Then coverage for theses components should be 100%
- [ ] And public code review should state for maintainability

## How to implement integration tests? (2.5)
### Integration and Unit vs System tests
- [ ] What's the difference?
- [ ] How to simplify and isolate tests?
- [ ] How can we determine scope just looking code?
- [ ] How build tool differs unit vs integration and system tests?

### Demo
- [ ] Developing isolated state-based test
- [ ] Developing isolated interaction-based test
### Hands-on
- [ ] Given legacy codebase with Processing component
- [ ] When developers analyse and refactor production codebase for testability
- [ ] And cover this component with maintainable _unit_ isolated autotests
- [ ] Then coverage for theses component should be 100%
- [ ] And public code review should state for maintainability

## How to achieve tests maintainablity with reusable fixture? (2.5)
### Fixture
- [ ] Fixture value for maintainablity and readability
### Implementing reusable fixture
- [ ] Test cases inheritance
- [ ] [Framework tooling](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Test-fixtures)
- [ ] Fixture Builders
- [ ] Runners
- [ ] Rules
### Demo
- [ ] Fixture builder implementation
### Hands-on
- [ ] Given current test codebase
- [ ] When developers analyse and refactor test codebase for maintainability
- [ ] Then fixture builders introduced
- [ ] And public code review should state for tests maintainability

## How to achieve tests maintainablity with development process? (2.5)
### Tests code quality achievement
- [ ] Broke test first
- [ ] Coverage analysis
- [ ] Tests code review
- [ ] Mutation coverage tools
### Demo
- [ ] Broke test first
- [ ] Mutation coverage report
### Tests code quality anti-patterns
- [ ] "Tests aren't code"
- [ ] Large low-cohesive tests
- [ ] Non-communicative names
- [ ] Fixture doubling
- [ ] 100% coverage
### Hands-on
- [ ] Given test codebase
- [ ] When developers analyse and refactor test codebase for maintainability
- [ ] Then cross-team code review should state for tests maintainability

- [ ] CSS
- [ ] JS
### Demo

- [ ] Selenium API
- [ ] Selenide library API
- [ ] Driver manager library API

- [ ] Browser headless mode
### UI tests maintainability
- [ ] Whats the problem with Selenium/Selenide tests?
- [ ] Page Object pattern
- [ ] Step Object pattern
### Hands-on
